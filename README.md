# NerfGunFaceRecognition  
Facial detection based on opencv. This code is written for a chamber-type nerf gun with stepper motors.  

A lot of this is based on this awesome guy:  
Adrian Rosebrock, OpenCV Face Recognition, PyImageSearch, https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/09/24/opencv-face-recognition/  
  
Definitely take a look at his tutorials for anything opencv + python.
